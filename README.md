1. I chose to develop a responsive web page where I structure it with HTML body ( header / main / footer ) 
2. I added the CDN of Bootstrap to use the components and the features of it .
3. Internet was my friend navigating for photos and some modern design. 
4. I tested it on my phone to see the final results. 
I hope you like it! Let me know your opinion.
